            <p>Hi! I'm Tweety Bird, the cutest and cleverest canary around!</p>
            <p>I love singing, outsmarting Sylvester, and enjoying life in my cozy cage.</p>

                <p>I first appeared in 1942 and have been charming audiences ever since. My signature catchphrase is "I
                    tawt I taw a puddy tat!" Even though I'm small, I always find a way to stay one step ahead of that
                    sneaky cat, Sylvester. Did you know? I was originally pink when I first appeared in "A Tale of Two
                    Kitties," but later
                    changed to my iconic yellow color. I live with my loving owner, Granny, and I'm always finding new
                    ways to escape Sylvester’s endless
                    pursuit. One of my favorite pastimes is singing, and I’ve even won an Academy Award for Best
                    Animated Short
                    Film! My character is known for being both adorable and surprisingly cunning—despite my innocent
                    looks, I
                    always manage to turn the tables on my enemies!</p>
